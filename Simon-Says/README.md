simon_says.py is an implementation of the popular Simon Says game on RaspberryPi, using generic hardware in order to build a fully-functional physical game.

Game description:
  1. The computer will generate a sequence of flashing lights, each followed by a unique sound.
  2. The user must repeat the sequence by clicking the correct buttons, if the user was correct - the computer will append another random step to the sequence.
  3. If the user makes a mistake in the sequence, the game is lost and can be started over.

simon_senses.py is an extention to the above simon_says.py game, instead of clicking buttons to replicate the sequence I used different sensors.
