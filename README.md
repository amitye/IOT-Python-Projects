# Python-Projects

This repository holds two projects:
  1. Simon-Says is an implementation of the popular simon says game for which I built the hardware and software parts.
  2. Sensor-Data-To-AWS is a project in which I have built a grid of sensors connected to RaspberryPi.
     The sensors send data once every selected interval and reports the data to AWS to be later analized with Elasticsearch tools.
